			<h2 class="heading">Why a cookbook?</h2>
			<p>
			This cookbook is what I have learned over three years of cooking for myself. Sometimes they're amazing recipes that take a lot of time and will cost a few more dollars than I am used to. But most of the time they're just really easy, cheap, unhealthy, but absolutely delicious recipes that I love.
			Honestly when I make the few really good recipes that I love it makes me quite happy to share them, but at the same time very upset because I KNOW it's delicious so why would I want to share especially because it was expensive just to buy a small pack of chicken. >:(
