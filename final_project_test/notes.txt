javascript

if(the book = book 1){
	.book background color = color of the book it's on
}

if the book is hovered on, then make the ones on top float above it
^ try to use javascript for this maybe?

figure out how to make it flip to the next page once you actually click it

phone version---
make the entire page one book
make a hamburger and write that it's cause I felt i wasn't putting enough extra stuff into my webpage and needed to add something extra


NEED TO DO---
- Make the words on the books a different color
- Make the red book a book that's easier to read (look up the spines of books)
- Change the size of the recipe book

RED BOOK PAGE---
- The entire page will be bigger than the other books
- Table of contents will be what recipes are in it
- If a certain recipe is clicked maybe make it flip to there?
	- Look up how to do a flipping animation
- And then there's a tab that will take you back to the table of contents?
	-if(the page isn't on the first page){
	make a tab that will appear on the top left side saying (table of contents)
	}


	.backleftpage
		if (it's the first page of the book){
		backleftpage background-color = background color of the book;
		}


--making the page turn if I click on it
if (i clik the page){
	if (whatever the page is == the page number){}
	make the y axis rotation go 100%
}
see somehow what the page number is and make it go up everytime the page flips right, if it flips backwards then the value is -1 or whatever.
